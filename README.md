# CLI-Library-System

Introduction
The implementation is a software program that aims to create a simple
library system using Python. It has been developed by W.A.T.S.
Wickramaarachchi as part of EEI3372 Programming in Python. The program
is designed to allow users to perform basic library functions such as adding
books, borrowing books, returning books, and displaying the available books
in the library.

Assumptions:
The following assumptions were made during the development of the
program:
1. The library system will only handle books and not other types of media such as DVDs or
CDs.
2. The library system will have a limited number of books and borrowing/returning books will
be done manually without any physical transactions.
3. The program will be run in a command-line interface (CLI) without any graphical user
interface (GUI).
4. The user inputs will be validated to ensure they are in the correct format and within the
expected range.

Problems Faced and Solutions:
During the development of the program, the following problems were
encountered
1. Problem: Validating user inputs to ensure they are in the correct format and within the
expected range. Solution: I implemented input validation to ensure that user inputs are in the
correct format and within the expected range. I also provided error messages and prompts to
guide users in providing correct inputs
